`--host=0.0.0.0`

This allows other devices in your network to access your Angular app (e.g., from your phone or another computer).

`--disable-host-check` (Deprecated in newer Angular versions, but still works in some cases)

Disables security checks for the Host header.
Useful when testing on different devices but not recommended for production.
